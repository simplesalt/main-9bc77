      I’ve found the following thinkers and projects influential to how I
      approach my work and life.


      Usually, the practices that generate excellent security also generate
      efficient, consistent, high-quality products and services. While there

      are some best practices and knowledge unique to security, it is mostly
      technical and fundamentally transient: the most important security issues
      of 10 years ago rarely apply today, and there’s no reason to think that
      the challenges and accompanying strategies of today will apply in 10
      years. The only enduring patterns deeply coincide with good design.


      ## About Quantitative Thinking


      [How to Measure
      Anything](https://www.google.com/books/edition/How_to_Measure_Anything/693e2X6XV3MC)
      – Often we have a hard time choosing how to measure success. This is a
      critical decision: if you incent them, your teams will work to optimize to
      the metrics you choose. If you choose poorly, they may reduce what you
      actually want in favor of what you measure. This is especially true of
      continuous improvement the Deming way: the foundation of improvement is
      measurement. This book guides you toward how to measure your true goals.
      There are many practical examples and exercises. Hubbard followed up with
      a [more targeted book for
      security](https://www.google.com/books/edition/How_to_Measure_Anything_in_Cybersecurity/8gulDAAAQBAJ),
      which also has excellent examples and also slightly rebukes the security
      industry: apparently we need special, remedial education.


      [Envisioning Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei) –
      Equally important to choosing metrics is communicating them. People are
      wildly different in how they receive and process information, and most
      aren’t natively fluent in math. Tufte wrote this book in the 70s; it’s
      full of examples for presenting complicated information visually for a
      variety of audiences.


      [Google SRE](https://sre.google/books/) – Google’s resiliency engineering
      team has written several books applying strategies to measure and
      communicate the resilience of its applications. The series is an excellent
      case study for the principles described in the first two books of this
      section – they explain challenges, approaches, and options for improving
      performance in a domain dominated for 30 years by two (bad) metrics.

      [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/) – Although he doesn’t post
      much anymore, his thoughts on leading technical teams are as true now as
      they were 20 years ago. I read two of his
      [recommended](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Peopleware/DVlsAQAAQBAJ)[
      books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/\_/20zXQQAACAAJ) and also
      recommend them. I especially appreciate his guide to UI/UX design, which
      share a lot in common with Shingo’s ideas about mistake-proofing.


      [Richard
      Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,\_Mr.\_Feynman!)
      – The celebrated [sex
      symbol](https://calisphere.org/item/10bedb2c1485caf64e851f4e75fe0214/) of
      theoretical physics, Dr. Feynman wrote two books that combine commentary
      on human nature with anecdotes from his crazy life. He has written one of
      the most compelling arguments about how science can control a fundamental
      human failing: to lie to ourselves. His commentary on cargo cults also
      highlights the pitfalls of prioritizing the shape of a solution over its
      function.


      [Alcoholics
      Anonymous](https://www.aa.org/pages/en_US/read-the-big-book-and-twelve-steps-and-twelve-traditions)
      – AA addresses the same temptation toward self-deception that Feynman
      discusses. Unlike science, its solution is best at addressing lies that
      are not objective or easily measured. Like Deming and SPC, its model for
      success is an ongoing effort: it starts with a frank assessment of the
      problem and iteratively addresses root causes in order of importance.
