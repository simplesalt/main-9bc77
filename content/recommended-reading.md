      I’ve found the following thinkers and projects influential to how I
      approach my work and life.


      Usually, the practices that generate excellent security also generate
      efficient, consistent, high-quality products and services. While there

      are some best practices and knowledge unique to security, it is mostly
      technical and fundamentally transient: the most important security issues
      of 10 years ago rarely apply today, and there’s no reason to think that
      the challenges and accompanying strategies of today will apply in 10
      years. The only enduring patterns deeply coincide with good design.


      ## About People




      ## About Process


      [W. Edward Deming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pXu0qxtWPg) – Widely
      considered the forefather of Lean, Six Sigma, Statistical Process Control,
      Toyota Production System, and modern process engineering, Deming’s
      thoughts on quality and governance have become ubiquitous. In the spirit
      of science and Feynman’s writings, he emphasized true understanding of how
      work is done, statistical analysis of the results, and a spirit of
      objective truth over wishful thinking. I’ll highlight two: he addressed a
      standard management practice of holding employees accountable for
      performance outside their control, that this is a convenient
      self-deception on their part. He also addresses another opportunity for
      lies: after an improvement project is complete, you must check whether it
      has delivered the improvements you expected in a statistically significant
      way.


      [Shigeo Shingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeo_Shingo) – Shigeo
      wrote some technical books in the 1980s about how to set up a
      manufacturing plant for maximal efficiency, providing excellent practical
      examples to Deming’s theories. While those books were foundational in
      manufacturing circles, his ideas have broad applicability to everyday
      life. Two of his ideas have strongly influenced me: First, a high barrier
      to change can dramatically slow continuous

      improvement. Second, mistake-proofing (Poka Yoke) processes can invisibly
      reduce decisions and failures, which collectively improves quality and
      efficiency.


      [Phoenix
      ](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/)[Project](https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/)
      – The Phoenix project applies many of the process engineering practices
      from Deming, Shingo, and other process engineering things to IT work.
      Before this book, IT was culturally risk-averse because internal customers
      expected perfection and punished failure. As a result, IT developed a
      culture where failure was unacceptable, dominated by huge projects to
      design and built utopias. The book addresses this lie:  failure is natural
      because people fail, and proposed a model intuitive to Deming but
      earth-shattering to IT: if a system’s resiliency and success hinges on
      people performing tasks perfectly, then it is a poorly designed system and
      the only rational fix is to change the system to be resilient to
      individual failure. The lessons in this book are not IT-specific – they
      can be equally applied to any team paid to think.


      [Go](https://golang.org/doc/faq#principles) – Go is a computer language
      created by some computer science rockstars. It has many technical
      advantages that get most of the press, but its biggest advantage is a
      human one: it encourages people to write code that others can easily
      understand. This is subtly the most important because in a product which
      consists solely of instructions, understanding it comprises the biggest
      share of the work in changing it. Making it easier to change enables the
      only reliable path to excellence: continuous improvement.


      ## About Quantitative Thinking


      [How to Measure
      Anything](https://www.google.com/books/edition/How_to_Measure_Anything/693e2X6XV3MC)
      – Often we have a hard time choosing how to measure success. This is a
      critical decision: if you incent them, your teams will work to optimize to
      the metrics you choose. If you choose poorly, they may reduce what you
      actually want in favor of what you measure. This is especially true of
      continuous improvement the Deming way: the foundation of improvement is
      measurement. This book guides you toward how to measure your true goals.
      There are many practical examples and exercises. Hubbard followed up with
      a [more targeted book for
      security](https://www.google.com/books/edition/How_to_Measure_Anything_in_Cybersecurity/8gulDAAAQBAJ),
      which also has excellent examples and also slightly rebukes the security
      industry: apparently we need special, remedial education.


      [Envisioning Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei) –
      Equally important to choosing metrics is communicating them. People are
      wildly different in how they receive and process information, and most
      aren’t natively fluent in math. Tufte wrote this book in the 70s; it’s
      full of examples for presenting complicated information visually for a
      variety of audiences.


      [Google SRE](https://sre.google/books/) – Google’s resiliency engineering
      team has written several books applying strategies to measure and
      communicate the resilience of its applications. The series is an excellent
      case study for the principles described in the first two books of this
      section – they explain challenges, approaches, and options for improving
      performance in a domain dominated for 30 years by two (bad) metrics.
