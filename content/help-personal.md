## I believe

The biggest lie is that we should be enough – to be independent, to be in control, to be strong, to do it all yourself. To need help is shameful: an indication that you are a less-valuable person.

The truth is that we are each deeply imperfect, and our best moments are when we accomplish things together.

## My purpose

I am made to grow and to help others grow.

### What success looks like

We grow by learning. We learn by iteratively practicing and reflecting.

We grow faster by practicing more effectively and reflecting more immediately. Practicing is accelerated by building productive habits and deconstructing unhelpful ones. Reflecting relies on insight provided by others.

I am deeply interested in the wellbeing of the people around me and invest effort toward their benefit. I also value my time – there’s a lot I want to do and become. If you feel the same, [let’s talk](/chat-personal/) about how we could help each other.

## How you could help me

### Feedback

My growth is sometimes limited in reflection. If you notice that I am trapped by implicit lies or unexamined assumptions, please explain them to me.

My growth is sometimes limited in practice. If you notice a pattern within me that seems to block a habit change I desire, please ask me about it.

### External Processing

My growth is sometimes bottlenecked by my ability to think through new ideas. I have noticed that I am much faster at this when doing so collaboratively. If you’d like to get together to talk about the patterns in life, I’m usually looking for more opportunities to bounce ideas back and forth.

### Encouragement

I thrive on collaboration and appreciate specific connections, including:

* responding thoughtfully to my content and ideas
* expressing appreciation for efforts I've applied to your benefit
* helping me stay focused on my stated goals and priorities. This can be as simple as an out-of-the-blue message, eg. "What is your top priority right now? What is your next step? How much of that step can you do today?"
* encouraging notes about recent work
* suggested solutions to problems I've identified but not yet solved
* challenge my root cause analysis when you suspect it is flawed

## How I can help you

### Radical encouragement

I persuade the people around me that they are valuable, worth loving, and capable of good. If you have doubts about whether that’s true of you and want those doubts to decrease, I may be able to help.

### Listening and questions

If you have thoughts you want to verbalize, need another perspective, or need to identify your next right step, I may be able to help.

### Something else?

Let me know - be brave.
