## I believe

The biggest lie is that we should be enough – to be independent, to be strong, to do it all yourself. To need help is shameful: an indication that you are a less-valuable person.

The truth is that we are each deeply imperfect, and our best moments are when we accomplish things together, whether achieving at the same time or asynchronously.

I am deeply interested in the wellbeing of the people around me and invest effort toward their benefit. I also value my time – there’s a lot I want to do. If you’re the same, let’s talk about how we could help each other.

## My goals

I am made to grow.

I am made to help others grow.

We grow by learning. We learn by iteratively practicing and reflecting.

We grow faster by practicing more effectively and reflecting more quickly. Practicing is accelerated by building productive habits and deconstructing unhelpful ones. Reflecting relies on insight provided by others.

## How you could help me

### Feedback

My growth is sometimes bottlenecked by the insight and hard truths I receive from others. If you notice that I am trapped by implicit lies or unexamined assumptions, please explain them to me. If you notice a habit within me that seems to block the growth I intend to practice, please ask me about it.

### External Processing

My growth is sometimes bottlenecked by my ability to think through new ideas. I have noticed that I am much faster at this when doing so collaboratively. If you’d like to get together to talk about the patterns in life, I’m usually looking for more opportunities to bounce ideas back and forth.

### Addressing Shame & Escapism

I sometimes avoid practicing by shame about my failure and an instinct to escape from the self-perception of inadequacy. If you see me doing this, please en*courage* me to persist over that instinct.

### Encouragement

I appreciate any specific positive connection – engaging with content, tagging, holding me accountable to my stated goals, or sending specific positive messages.

## How I can help you

### Radical Encouragement

I persuade the people around me that they are valuable, worth loving, and capable of good. If you have doubts about whether that’s true of you and want those doubts to decrease, I may be able to help.

### Listening and Questions

If you have thoughts you want to verbalize, need another perspective, or are having trouble identifying your next right step, I may be able to help.
