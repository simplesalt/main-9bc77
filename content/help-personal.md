## I believe

The biggest lie we are told is that we should be enough by ourselves – to be independent, to be strong, to do it all yourself. To need help is shameful: an indication that you are a less-valuable person.

The truth is that we are each deeply imperfect, and our best moments are when we accomplish things together, whether achieving together or asynchronously.

I am deeply interested in the wellbeing of the people around me and invest effort toward their benefit. I also value my time – there’s a lot I want to do. If you’re the same, let’s talk about how we could help each other.

## How you could help me

### Feedback

The rate of my growth is sometimes bottlenecked to the rate I receive new perspectives and hard truths from others. If you notice that there are more effective ways to do something, please tell me.

### External Processing

My growth is sometimes bottlenecked by my ability to think through new ideas. I have noticed that I am much faster at this when doing so collaboratively. If you’d like to get together to talk about the patterns in life, I’m usually looking for more opportunities to bounce ideas back and forth.

### Encouragement

I appreciate any positive connection – engaging with content, tagging, holding me accountable to my stated goals, or sending specific positive messages.

## How I can help you

### Radical Encouragement

I persuade the people around me that they are valuable, worth loving, and capable of good. If you have doubts about whether that’s true of you and want those doubts to decrease, I may be able to help.

### Listening and Questions

If you have thoughts you want to verbalize, need another perspective, or are having trouble identifying your next right step, I may be able to help.
