## How you could help me

I need partners and friends to grow and achieve my goals.

### Feedback

If I missed the real root cause on something important, please ask me about it.

If bad habits block my top goals and I seem stuck, please ask me about them.

### Collaboration

Many of my ideas are bad. If youâ€™d like to get together to bounce ideas back and forth, [hit me up](/meet).

### Encouragement

I get huge benefit from adhoc positive outreach, especially:

* helping me stay focused on my goals. This can be as simple as an out-of-the-blue, "What is your top priority right now? What is your next step? How much of that step can you do today?"
* responding thoughtfully to ideas I've shared
* appreciation for effort I applied to your benefit

## How I can help you

I am most comfortable with explicit expectations, when I know your Why. If you think I can help you with something, just ask.

### Radical encouragement

I persuade the people around me that they are valuable, worth loving, and capable of good. If you need to hear that, [hit me up](/meet).

### Listening and questions

If you have thoughts you want to verbalize, need another perspective, or need to identify your next right step, [hit me up](/meet).

## Caveat Emptor

People frequently characterize me as:

* salty
* blunt
* intense
* demanding
* forgetful
* analytical
* confident
* bad at follow-through
* excessively authentic
* inconsiderate
* squirrel!
