I want to help you find the most effective ways to solve your security problems.  I believe strongly in well-chosen metrics, continuous improvement, and doing simple things well.

My mission is to persuade the people around me that they are valuable, worth loving, and are capable of good.

I am smart and get things done.  I find complicated, technical things easy and enjoy explaining them simply.  I believe that scalable excellence depends on an honest assessment of the current state, so believe strongly in hard truths over pleasant lies.  I enjoy collaboration, high-trust environments, building people up, and long-term success.
