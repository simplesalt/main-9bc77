I help people find the most effective ways to stop internet crime.  I approach most challenges through continuous improvement, well-chosen metrics, and doing simple things well.  I make hard things easy. 

I am here to help make things better. My top priority is to persuade the people around me that they are valuable, worth loving, and are capable of good.  

I find complicated concepts easy and enjoy explaining them simply.
