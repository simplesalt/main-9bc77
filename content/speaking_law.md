## Topics

### The Right Way to Outsource

_qualifying CLEs: ethics, wellbeing_
Paradoxically, one of the best strategies for preventing internet crime usually grows firm business, decreases client delinquency, and lowers partner stress. In this talk, I explain how the proper outsourcing approach can help you protect sensitive client data and get more clients.

### Protect Yourself and Get More Done: Passwords Done Right

_qualifying CLE: wellbeing, practice management_
Everyone agrees: passwords are annoying. They slow us down, break things when most inconvenient, and it seems like an impossible feat to follow all the best practices recommended by industry. Worse, they are important: password problems are the most common mechanism for successful internet crime. What are you supposed to do?

This talk teaches my proven solution to these problems. It is easy, luddite-friendly, and is usually the single most effective way to prevent internet crime for firms under 50.

Also available as a 2-hour workshop; participants get set up, practice the methods, and create a detailed plan to implement it firm-wide.

### What Title Companies can Teach Us

_qualifying CLEs: ethics_
The title industry was one of the first to be comprehensively and methodically attacked by internet crime rings. It is no surprise: a single title company may process millions of dollars in transactions every day, each with new people unfamiliar with the process and no recourse if a criminal steps in to divert a payment. Many legal firms' trust accounts have the same exposure and significantly less protection. This talk explains the easy, effective ways that your firm can prevent trust account fraud.

### How to Think about Cybersecurity Insurance

_qualifying CLEs: practice management_
Attorneys have mixed feelings about cyber insurance: policies are expensive, demand extensive documentation for eligibility, and have so many carve-outs that sometimes even they don't read the whole policy. Yet in an age of exploding internet crime, it would be foolhardy to skip. This talk explains how different firms' risk profile compares to common coverage, how the right policy should fit into an overall risk plan, and even how the wrong carrier can increase your risk of attack.

### The Best Way to Protect Sensitive Client Information

_qualifying CLEs: ethics_
Safeguarding client secrets is critical to maintaining your firm's reputation. But clients can be inconsistent, misinformed, or even sloppy about protecting their own secrets. If their failure results in a material cyber incident, you both stand to lose. How can you help them stay safe without straying into their accountability?

### Security Compliance done Cheap and Easy

_qualifying CLEs: professionalism, practice management_
Many firms must satisfy customer due diligence security requirements. This can be unpredictable and and expensive, especially when you follow conventional approaches. This talk describes five creative compliance strategies that could cut your compliance costs by 75%.

Also available as a 2-hour workshop; participants examine their Why for security compliance, apply the strategies, generate concrete solutions and next steps, and walk away with a personalized and ready-to-execute compliance delivery plan.

### How Worried Should I Be? Assessing Security Risk

_qualifying CLEs: practice management_
The cyber and audit industries have an open secret: their one-size-fits-all approach is designed for CYA and defensibility at the expense of effective crime prevention or accurate risk advisory. In truth, practical security risk differs wildly between firms, depending on their business model, customers, culture, and more.

This talk explains a practical guide to estimating the risk security threats pose to your firm's financial health and goals.

Also available as a 2-hour workshop; participants will complete a statistical model and walk away with a clear financial picture of their firm's risk from internet crime.
