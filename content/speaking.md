      ### What American title companies learned the hard way
      Paying for real estate in the USA is an attractive target for internet criminals. A single title company may process millions in transactions every day, each with new people unfamiliar to the process and no recourse if a criminal steps in to divert a payment. They solved this challenge. We look at the top approaches they developed and how they can work for other businesses.

      ### Demystifying the Cloud
      Skeptics famously describe the cloud as "someone else's computer," implying it is no better than doing it yourself. Yet many companies are saving millions in IT and efficiency costs by moving to cloud-native designs. Other cloud migration projects have failed, overbudget and with nothing to show. Why? In this talk, we describe the true benefits of the cloud and the hallmarks of a strategy that will succeed. Also available as a workshop in which participants generate an action plan toward a cloud-first strategy.

      ### How to think about Cybersecurity insurance
      People have mixed feelings about insurance - policies are often expensive and have lengthy eligibility requirements. Yet in an age of rising internet crime, it would be foolhardy to skip one. This talk explains which businesses benefit most from insurance, how the right plan fits into a overall crime-prevention plan, and even how a policy can increase your risk of attack.    

      ### The best way to protect sensitive client information
      Safeguarding client secrets is critical to maintaining your trusted reputation. But clients often are inconsistent, misinformed, or even sloppy about protecting secrets they send. How can you efficiently serve them while ensuring they are protected? This talk describes how.

      ## For Leaders of businesses 100-500

      ### How to delight customers with good security
      Many businesses experience customer oversight that can incur significant cost and can extend the sales process - questionnaires and audits and redlined contract addendums. Many leaders see these as distractions or battles. In this talk, we discuss strategies to streamline and accelerate these activities. Done right, your security responses can even be a differentiating value proposition than can help you win bids. Also available as a workshop, with each participant generating a personalized plan for their business.

      ### How to hire and manage a cybersecurity team
      Many senior leaders find security mystifying - they do not understand the work those teams do and what a successful team looks like. As a result, many security teams are misaligned to the rest of their organization and spend resources for no benefit. This talk describes how to help your security teams be most effective. 

      ### Why most Lean Six Sigma initiatives fail
      Since the 1980s, the business world has been awash in Lean or Six Sigma efforts. Often billed as the path for transformations to unlock double or triple-digit growth, they usually fail to deliver and are cut at the next reorg. Yet every decade since has been dotted with highly successful organizations that swear by its principles. This talk explains the underlying value proposition of Lean Six Sigma, why most companies fail at it, and how to unlock the value it promises.
