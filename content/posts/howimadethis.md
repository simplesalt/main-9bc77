title: Webhosting the Easy Way
excerpt: >-
  One of the most exciting things about modern cloud-first IT is that you don't have to manage as much - you can have high-level services that operate with resilience and security you'll never be able to build yourself.  That's well and good for big companies and fancy prod dev shops, but how does the little guy get a piece of that action?

Maintaining a web presence is annoying.  If you want to do it yourself, you can buy VPS and put a CMS on it, you can even use a cloud hosting provider that's mostly doing the same thing.  Even if you go buy a fancy drag-n-drop like squarespace, there's limitations, bugs, and a general lack of transparency between what you want and what they're doing. 

You could go the other way and just hitch your wagon to a content platform like medium, linkedin, or instagram.  But if they then go pull a facebook, you're hosed!  Your entire following is tied to that platform.  

If you do it yourself, you incur not only the startup effort to learn how to use it, but also (and more insidiously) an ongoing operational commitment: patching, fixes, and just care-and-feeding. All you really want to do is deliver quality content.  

It shouldn't be this hard to create something good and cheap and also retain control of it.   

I have found the solution, friends.  For $12/year (cost of a domain) and about 3 hours of learning and setup, I built this website, complete with the best resiliency, security, and performance available to modern science.  If you can live without custom-colored text or mid-90s web effects, you can too.
