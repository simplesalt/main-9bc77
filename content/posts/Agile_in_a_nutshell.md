A lot has been written about Agile and its faster and crazier sibling DevOps.  I won't repeat it all here, but I'm generally sold.  For those that aren't convinced or are trying to convince others, you may like this [great infographic](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/creativity_erasers) that explains the most important parts.  This time, it's an artist describing their process of creation, but the same lessons hold: failure (that is: a non-ideal outcome) is not shameful.  It is an inherent part of creation, and to think otherwise is just lying to yourself.  Building something of value will always involve a lot of "missteps."  Deming was right - continuous improvement consistently beats dazzling one-time herculean efforts - but continuous improvements don't make the news.  How do you celebrate and market continuous improvement?
