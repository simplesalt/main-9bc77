This page contains how you could help me by providing insight and perspectives I'm missing; I'll keep it updated as I develop new content. If you want to be notified when I post new needs, just paste this page into something like [webcrawl](https://webcrawl.io).


## Goals

I want to be a favorite content brand for mid-market CFOs, managing partners, GMs, and CIOs. 

This satisfies two goals: 
- my personal mission to demystify security.
- my professional goal to [grow Simple Salt](https://share.descript.com/view/4vY0XRtMzYx).

### Brand identity
I want to be uniquely known for the message that the conventional cyber and audit approaches mostly deliver defensibility. For those who want effective crime prevention, there is a better way. 

I want to be known as insightful, entertaining, and irreverent. I want to be a thought leader in security, business health, and organizational culture.

## Needs

### Content Ideas

I need to know what my audience wants to hear about. [Tell me](https://forms.wix.com/f/7064931963936702757) whenever you think of something. Feel free to share this link with others, with the offer that if I get enough requests on a topic, I may answer it.

### Draft Feedback

I have drafts of the talks and articles I'm working on. You can find them listed below. Each draft allows comments - please add your thoughts directly to the draft. If you want your comments private, just shoot them to me however you want. I include specific questions as comments in the beginning of each piece. You cannot mess anything up, so let it rip.

### Specifics

I am generally looking for:

* Are the ideas and depth a good fit for my target audience?
* what may distract or turn off my audience?
* what may confuse my audience?
* Where do I try to fit too many ideas into too small a space?
* Where do I sacrifice clarity in pursuit of accuracy?
* What content could be eliminated without compromising the message?

### Current drafts

| Audience | Title | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mid-market CIOs, CFOs, CEOs | Security Compliance for people with better things to do | Ebook, target publish date: JUN24. A practical guide to security compliance, designed to be read on the plane, etc. About half done, expected 20k words. |
| Business leaders | [Succeed, Trust, Improve](https://share.descript.com/view/j0AHjp834GN) | A motivational/Ted-talkish piece about the foundational elements of success within a business context. |
| Lawyers | [Thinking about Risk](https://app.yoodli.ai/share/qJmDWvP8) | created for a podcast appearance. I never got to deliver it because the host took my interview in another direction. |

### complete

I've polished and delivered these. I'm still interested in the same feedback, though not as urgently.

| Audience | Title | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CIOs of bricknmortar companies 50+ | [Securing your Cloud: Three Objectives you Must get Right](https://app.yoodli.ai/share/Dw6CZ3sg) | not my target content or brand, done to build audience generally, topic was requested. |
| CFOs or managing partners of high-trust professional svcs firms | [Simple Salt intro pitch](https://share.descript.com/view/eK61aJt9HXT) | I don't always say all this in most sales calls. These are the available ideas in case they're relevant. Each slide is really an opportunity to ask them questions about their own experience with security. |
| Owners of businesses <50 | [Stop Internet crime and grow your business by outsourcing IT and finance](https://app.yoodli.ai/share/A8hnTCw5) | Thought provoking but probably better at a slower pace. |
