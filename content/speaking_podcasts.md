I authentically share my stories, realizations, and current journeys in business and personal growth.

### Professionally

I demystify security and show business leaders the easy and effective ways to stop internet crime. These topics resonate best with lawyers, finance leaders, and the occasional CEO.

### Personally

I persuade people of their value and that even if painful, their growth is worth pursuing.

These domains are deeply interconnected for me.

### That Wasn't Too Hard

In March 2021, I launched [an educational podcast](https://thatwasnttoohard.win) with Maha Mubarak focused on lean, metrics, business culture, UI design, and other topics. It met some of our learning and growth goals, but we paused the project after 6 months. One of the things we learned is how much work it is to produce a podcast :smiley:.

Someday we might get back to it; we both have passion in the topics.
