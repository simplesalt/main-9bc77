## Introductions

### Content Partners

I would like to meet thoughtful people who talk about risk in finance, legal, and technology. If you think we would have good chemistry and complementary messages, connect us.

## Event organizers

I speak at industry events, demystifying security and internet crime. Connect me to people who need sensible security content.

### Referral partners

We often come alongside management consulting teams to cover security as part of their larger strategic advisory engagements. This is especially true for fractional CFOs and CIOs. If a consulting firm with matching values is looking for a security partner, please connect us.

### Direct Clients

Businesses who need to protect themselves from internet crime. This is often high-trust professional services firms between 50-200.

## Feedback

I usually have several open questions I want opinions about. You can find the current set here:
